I knew what it was
She in, she out, she wanna see what this 'bout
She know my money like six fives
She gotta sit with six guys
I'm on the road to success
She wanna ride better pick sides
I know I missed my last time
But I know Ima get it like this time
I walk in the middle like Moses
Throw my stick in the river and broke it
I'm still in a shivering motion
And I treat these bitches like hoes
I ain't got time for emotion
I send her back to her bro friend
I got my eyes on the prize still
I'm just getting ready to omit
I gotta figure something out um
Let me call Siifu and see what he talking bout
