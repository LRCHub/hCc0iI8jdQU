Yesterday I worked from 9 to 5
Caught in a trap
To keep myself alive
Everyday I ask the question why
The search for the key
To the song alive

Now I know the way
To give my life a meaning
Living for today
Owhow I love that feeling

Everyday, let your music play
Now the time is right
Tonight is the night

Now I'm free
Let it be
